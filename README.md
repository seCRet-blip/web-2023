# Web-2023 Assignment Project

This repository contains the assessment project for the 2023 Web Development course. The aim of this project was to identify key aspects of modern website development and incorporate these elements into the design and implementation of the website.

- **Image Slider (with text overlay)**:

  this used the modern design of having big images as well as having large text displayed on top all of the 3 websites I used as reffernce have this elemement on there page as it gets there point accross very quickly and keeps the user engaged.
- **Card Slider (with text card and image cards)**:

  the use of cards is another element all the websites have some form of card formate eg, text card, image card and a combination of both. using this type of modern web design makes the website flow better and gives the user enough information while also being engaging and if the user wants more information they can click the card to get more. I demonstrated this to the best of my current ablity on the about page with the read more cards
- **Footer**:

  Another aspect I used was the use of columns and grids, having the combination of the two allows the content to be structured and well organized. and gives the framework that allows the developer to align elements consistently. 
- **Landing Image (with text overlay)**:  
  ![Landing Image](https://github.com/seCRet-blip/web-2023/assets/77824037/294071f1-ecda-46f0-bc69-d26d57c9c1d7)
  I called it a landing image but another name for it is a hero image this immediately catches the users attention and sets the tone for the website, most of the images on the site tend to relect the theme of the site In the code I tried to only get images that contained blue.
- **Cards (with a read more function)**:
