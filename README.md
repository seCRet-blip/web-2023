# Web-2023 Assignment Project

This repository contains the assessment project for the 2023 Web Development course. The aim of this project was to identify key aspects of modern website development and incorporate these elements into the design and implementation of the website. The website was developed using HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the Svelte framework. Visual Studio Code was the IDE used for this project.

## Design Elements & References

Here are some of the elements selected for the project:

## Project Components

The added components in the project include:

### Image Slider (with text overlay)

This used the modern design of having big images as well as having large text displayed on top all of the 3 websites I used as reference have this element on their page as it gets their point across very quickly and keeps the user engaged.

### Card Slider (with text card and image cards)

The use of a card slider is another element all the websites have some form of card format eg, text card, image card and a combination of both. Using this type of modern web design makes the website flow better and gives the user enough information while also being engaging and if the user wants more information they can click the card to get more, this also allows for grouping information together making the readability of the site better. I demonstrated this to the best of my current ability on the about page with the read more cards.

### Footer

Another aspect I used was the use of columns and grids, having the combination of the two allows the content to be structured and well organized. and gives the framework that allows the developer to align elements consistently. 

### Landing Image (with text overlay)

![Landing Image](https://github.com/seCRet-blip/web-2023/assets/77824037/294071f1-ecda-46f0-bc69-d26d57c9c1d7)

I called it a landing image but another name for it is a hero image this immediately catches the users attention and sets the tone for the website, most

 of the images on the site tend to reflect the theme of the site In the code I tried to only get images that contained blue.

### Cards (with a read more function)

Something I thought was cool was I created a bit of code that is used for the card slider, it's a component inside a component. And it also uses Svelte's syntax to create the whole slider and create the cards needed to be in the slider

Please refer to the file named Card.svelte for a more in-depth look. Another cool feature is that the site is completely responsive with the use of media queries.
